# <Refactoring-Horiseon>

## Description

This project was created in order to demonstrate refactoring of a webpage to modern coding standards and practices without changing or damaging the integrity of the webpage. 

The following changes were made to the original code :

- Updating one of the hyperlinks to properly work
- Adding in notes to the CSS file
- Reorganized the CSS code so that it goes codes that grouped together
- Consolidating redudent lines of code in the CSS
- Added in alternative texts to picture images
- Replacement of  'div' elements using semantic html.


## Installation

Clone a copy of the repository into local computer.
Ensure that the CSS stylesheet is still properly referenced on download
Open both ‘index-unedited.html’ and ‘index.html’ in proper code visual program to see the differences between the HTML codes. 

## Usage

This project can be used to see how semantic html elements can be utilized to structure the framework for an HTML file. For example, multiple ‘div’ elements have been replaced with semantic html elements. Additionally coding was updated to accessibility standards by adding in alternative texts to ‘img’ elements. Finally, comments were added in to the CSS stylesheet, indicating lines of code that pertained to different subsections in the HTML file. Also changes to the CSS file were made to help keep code in order in reference in the HTML file, and grouped together to have code that applies to same subsections together.
